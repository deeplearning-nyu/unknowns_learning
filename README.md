# Unknowns-learning-project

This repository hosts the implementation of TascRec, providing the codebase that complements the associated paper: "Cross-Reclassification: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Enhancing Classifier Robustness in Dynamic Environments" by Bruno Abrahao, Zheng Wang, Haider Ahmed, and Yuchen Zhu.

To run TascRec on computer vision datasets use

* experiments_tascrec_vision.py
* tascrec_vision.py

The repository also contains additional code for executing TascRec on tabular datasets utilizing SVM (Support Vector Machine) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithms.
